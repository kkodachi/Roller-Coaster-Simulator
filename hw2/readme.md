 Below is a list of keybinds to utilize the functionality of the program. Don't move the mouse in order to experience the ride feature, just press 'w' after running. Moving the mouse before/during the ride will cause the ride to go off track. To run call 'make' followed by './hw2 splines/<image of choice>' in the hw1 directory.

Keybinds:
‘1’: modify eye.x by 1.0
‘2’: modify eye.y by 1.0
‘3’: modify eye.z by 1.0
‘4’: modify center.x by 1.0
'5': modify center.y by 1.0
'6': modify center.z by 1.0
'a': toggle between adding or subtracting 1.0 from params above
‘t’: translate with OpenGLMatrix::Translate
‘Shift’: shift with OpenGLMatrix::Shift
Mouse movement: rotate with OpenGLMatrix::Rotate
‘r’: record 1000 screenshots in 15 fps, pair with 'w'
